# Circular movement forces

Now, in LO3 it talks about the type of forces accompanying an object moving in a circular path, if an object is moving in a circular path, for example attached by a string and used like a cowboy's rope, it has two forces, called centrifugal and centripetal forces. 

Centripetal, meaning that it is ***center attracted*** therefore, that's why its vector's direction is to the middle of the circle the object is moving in, centrifugal meaning ***center repelled***, therefore that's why its vector's direction is to the opposite of the center of the circle.

The velocity is in a constant, linear form in this state, how come that's true if there's something called centripetal acceleration?

Well, that's because angular and linear forms are different, this is angular acceleration which actually exists, in a linear form, the acceleration would be zero.
Said centripetal acceleration's magnitude is given by: $a_c = \dfrac{v^2}{r}$. Note that this is only the magnitude of the acceleration, the direction is always directed towards the center.
Angular velocity is the angle in radians divided by time.

When the object is let go, it goes in a path tangent to the circle. whose speed is $\omega r$.

Angular speed or velocity is measured in revolutions per minute as a standard.

To convert from the angular velocity unit into regular linear velocity, multiply the angular velocity by multiplying the angular velocity by $\dfrac{2\pi r}{60}$ if the angular velocity unit is in rpm (revolutions per minute).

The linear velocity (Tangential velocity) should be equal to the radius into the angular velocity in all cases.

In a circular path, if for example the object is held by a string, then the tension force is equal to the centripetal force, both in magnitude and direction.

Therefore, when doing exercises, if the object is at the horizontal position, then the tension force = the centripetal force = $\dfrac{mv^2}{r}$. When the object is at the vertical position but it's at south then the tension force equals: $\dfrac{mv^2}{r}+mg$ due to the effect of gravity, when it's at north then the tension force equals: $mg-\dfrac{mv^2}{r}$. When the object is moving very fast in an ellipse, the tension force approximately equals the centripetal force (not directly equal), if it's slow, then the tension force is gotten through its components. 

Inertial frames of reference is when an object exhibits inertia, they remain at rest or in a uniform state of motion without a change in motion unless acted upon by external forces.

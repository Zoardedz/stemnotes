# Mass

Mass is the resistance of an object to the change of velocity, this is true because mass is directly proportional to the inertia itself, the more you weigh the more you launch forward in a stopping vehicle (For example.). 
* It is a scalar quantity
* Its SI unit is Kg
* It's constant anywhere

# Weight

Weight is the force by which the object is directed to the center of another body. In other words, it's the magnitude of the net force required to prevent the body from falling freely.
* It is a vector quantity
* Its SI unit is N (Newton)
* It varies depending on the other object.

# Gravity and gravitational attraction force

Gravity and gravitational attraction force are two different things, sure but I want to know the difference, gravity is the quantity itself by which an object is pulled down, this is usually identified as the acceleration itself. The gravitational attraction force is when two objects exist, have mass and a distance between them. These objects have a gravitational attraction force but it's so small that it's extremely insignificant, unless we talk talk about planets then it's somewhat significant to their physics.

The general law of gravitation deduced by Isaac Newton is $F=G\dfrac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$ where F is the force measured in Newtons, G is a gravitational constant, deduced by using a torsion balance (Cavendish balance) invented by geologist Rev. John Michell, but the first time the value was recorded was by Henry Cavendish. This constant's value is: $G=6.6743*10^{-11}N\cdot m^2/kg^2$ . m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, r^2 is the square distance between the two objects.

In this case, F would be proportional to m1, m2 and have an inverse square proportionality with r.

There are action-reaction pairs that result as a gravitational attraction force.

# Gravitational field

The area of influence around an object in which other objects around it are affected by its gravity.
The larger a body gets, the more influence it has and the more gravity it has.
Therefore the gravity acceleration can get derived from the mass and the radius of the field.
$g=G\dfrac{m}{r^2}$

# Apparent weight and free fall

Now, any object that happens to be on a scale, its mass is measured by the incident force on the object by the scale itself as a normal force, not the actual weight of the object.

The apparent weight in an elevator, for example when not moving, it's equal to the weight of the body inside of it, as normal. But if the elevator is moving upwards, the body inside the elevator has a weight more than that of at normal state because when you go up you also try to resist the weight. When the elevator goes down, the weight decreases because it goes along the direction of the weight, so we feel weightless. When the force or normal force is equal to zero, this means that we're detached and in free fall, it can also mean that a string was broken and tension force is zero.

When going upward, the normal force is equal to $mg+ma$, when going downwards, the normal force is equal to $mg-ma$ and the order is ***IMPORTANT***.

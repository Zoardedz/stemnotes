# Overview

Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of chronic diseases that affect how the body controls the glucose/sugar levels in the blood, either concerning that the pancreas doesn't secrete a sufficient amount of insulin or that it secretes a sufficient amount, but the body is incapable of effectively using it. Said chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes (there's an untold type 3 diabetes which is referred to as Alzheimer's due to the incorporation of glucose and the brain as they believe that insulin dysregulation in the brain causes dementia.),, 
Hyperglycemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes, or prediabetes depending on the first name, Non-diabetic hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes) is when the blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be called diabetes (as in an interval range, but it's before the too-high mark.), people with pre-diabetes are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the risk can be reduced through lifestyle changes said in ways to avoid the disease.
Another type is Gestational diabetes which happens during pregnancy, but it may go away post-labor.

Type 1 diabetes is caused by not being able to make a sufficient amount of insulin, type 2 diabetes is caused by the tissues being resistant to insulin's effects.

Diabetes' mode of transmission is vertical (hereditary/genetic). Type 1 occurs due to the immune system attacking healthy tissue, usually starts when the immune system is fully developed in childhood.

Its risk factors depend on the type of diabetes, if it's family history then it may play in both types, if it's environmental factors and geography then it attributes to type 1. The main antibodies causing diabetes type 1 are called diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). The race is another significant factor, Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people are at higher risk.

Type 2, pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes are more prominent in obese individuals.
# Symptoms

Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly, in type 2 diabetes, the symptoms may be mild and may take many years to be noticed or realized, in type 1 diabetes, the symptoms seem to come quicker and more aggressively.

The symptoms may take months or even years to become completely onset.

The symptoms are as follows:

1. Feeling more thirsty than usual.
2. Urinating more.
3. High blood pressure.
4. Losing weight without trying.
5. Presence of ketones in the urine, which are the results of the breaking down of muscle due to lack of enough insulin. In relation, muscle loss also occurs due to the muscle being resistant against insulin and its effect, as a result it uses amino acids as an energy source.
6. Flu like symptoms during the build up of ketones (diabetic ketoacidosis).
7. Feeling tired and weak
8. Feeling irritable or having other mood swings.
9. Having blurry vision.
10. Having slow-healing sores.
11. Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.
12. Itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush (itching around the genitals but in the form of an infection.).
13. Fatigue.

Diabetes may branch into more complications, for example: diabetic retinopathy, which is the damaging of the blood vessels of the eye which could end in blindness (repelled by regular diabetic eye screening to check the state of the eye). Foot damage which is the poor blood flow to the feet or nerve damage, which increases the risk of more foot complications (foot ulcers), higher risk of heart attacks as it causes cardiovascular complications, stroke, nerve damage and kidney failure. Type 2 diabetes may also increase the risk of dementia.

# Type 1 (insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset)

Type 1 diabetes can start at any age, but it often starts during childhood or teen years. It's mainly characterized by deficient insulin production and the requirement of daily administration of insulin (administered based on a device called a continuous glucose monitor which uses a subcutaneous layer to get a somewhat accurate reading for example: Dexcom, Freestyle Libre and Omnipod monitors.)

# Type 2 (non-insulin dependent or adult onset)

Type 2 diabetes is the more common type which can start at any age, its more common in people older than 40. 

It mainly affects how the body uses the glucose for energy, which disallows the body from using insulin properly and as a result, increasing the glucose levels in the body, this causes serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels. It's often avoidable by lifestyle choices i.e by regular exercise, having a healthy diet, etc.

It's preferred to try and pickup the symptoms quickly and if felt that symptoms are true, consult a doctor.

# Gestational diabetes

It's the hyperglycemia whose blood glucose values are above normal but below the point of diabetes, this usually occurs during pregnancy but may cause problems to the carrier such as: Preeclampsia, whose symptoms include high blood pressure, too much proteins in the urine (as mentioned before in the muscle loss section) and swelling in the legs and feet.

It can also cause complications in the baby, for example: excess growth which makes the developing baby adapt and resist the disease the carrier is experiencing by making the pancreas produce more insulin, which could cause the baby to grow too large and cause a difficult birth (could sometimes lead to the requirement of a C-section (ولادة قيصري)). 

# Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycemia (IFG)

They're conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes, if people have these they're at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes.

# Prevention

Having a healthy lifestyle is an essential prerequisite to avoid diabetes, diabetes type 1 is inevitable depending on your relations and family history. Diabetes type 2, gestational and pre-diabetes are the avoidable types.

They're avoidable by:
1. Eating healthy foods and having a healthy diet, choose foods lower in fats, calories and high in fibers. Focus on fruits, veggies and whole grains.
2. Reach and keep a healthy body weight by losing excess weight if overweight as losing 7% of the entire body weight can significantly lower the risk of diabetes. (This should be done under supervision if pregnant.)
3. Not to smoke tobacco.
4. Stay physically active with at least 30 minutes of medium aerobic activity on most days of the week (to at least sum up to 150 minutes per week).

# Diagnosis

Early diagnosis can be accomplished through early blood tests for glucose levels, can also be obvious when foot ulcers are present or eye screening results are deteriorating.
# Treatment

People with type 1 diabetes need ***administered*** insulin injections for survival, type 2 diabetes patients require a healthy lifestyle to prevent the disease.

Some people with type 2 diabetes need to take medicine to help manage their blood glucose levels when physical activity is absent (people with old age probably can't do physical activities). These can include insulin injections (as long as it was concluded that the body is responsive to insulin) for example:

1. Metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others).
2. Sulfonylureas
3. Sodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors.

These may accompany medicine to lower blood pressure to reduce risk of complications.

These are fine to use, but the natural prevention is preferred.

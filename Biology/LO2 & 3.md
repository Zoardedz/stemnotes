- **Prokaryotic & Eukaryotic cells**

Cells, are the smallest building unit of life, they are split into two types: Prokaryotic cells and Eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes are called so due to the *Greek* derivation **“<font color="#4f81bd">before nucleus</font>”** while Eukaryotic means **“<font color="#4bacc6">true nucleus</font>”**.

To start off, we’ll talk about <em><font color="#f79646">Prokaryotic cells</font></em> since they’re the smaller brother of <em><font color="#f79646">Eukaryotic cells</font></em>, they’re way smaller than Eukaryotic cells and are way simpler, they’re all unicellular, *they don’t have a nucleus*, unlike eukaryotes, (*represented in the opposite figure*), the DNA is just floating about in the cytoplasm. The DNA in the following bacteria (prokaryote) is called circular DNA (note that DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic acid).

In normal eukaryotes, DNA is more *linear* (*called linear chromosomes, it can also take the form of circular molecules*), Prokaryotes are mostly things like bacterium and archaea, prokaryotes mostly reproduce through ***binary fission*** since they don’t have ***centrosomes or a nucleus** like a regular Eukaryote.*

***Prokaryotes*** mainly consist of no *nucleus* although it’s substituted area is called *nucleoid*, *cytoplasm (non-distinctive), plasmids (non-distinctive), a capsule, cell wall, outside pill lining (fimbriae) and flagellum (all of the previous are distinctive).* ***They also lack chloroplast and mitochondria or any membrane organelle, as they don’t have an endomembrane system. (they only have cell membrane)***.

Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand are relatively bigger in size as shown in the figure below.

They are multicellular (such as human cells and plant cells) AND unicellular (such as protists (Euglena and Paramecium for example)).

These cells have an actual organelle (component of cell) to contain the DNA called the nucleus, it contains all genetic information and is responsible for releasing RNA into the cytoplasm.

RNA is short for Ribonucleic acid, which is a polymer that is essential for most biological functions, it either performs the function itself (*non-coding RNA*) or by forming a template for other things to follow after for example for the production of proteins, it makes a certain amino acid structure that can be used as a base (messenger RNA (mRNA)) (which gets read by a ribosome throughout protein synthesis) 

it has pores for it to transport said RNA, they have actual centrosomes for a proper way of performing mitosis rather than doing binary fission, they can split into 2 cells using the centrosome.

Most Eukaryotes majorly lack the components that make Prokaryotes versatile and movable, however something like Euglena do have a flagellum. Plasmids are also present in some cases, although not here. Eukaryotes have chloroplasts, mitochondria, and an entire endomembrane system which differentiates it a lot from a regular prokaryote. We’ll talk about Eukaryotes’ internal structure in more detail. For now, just know that Prokaryotes only have the necessities like Ribosomes for proteins, Nucleoids for replication and other defining details. Both of them also have an area called cytosol (difference is that it doesn’t line the plasma membrane) while cytosol has organelles floating in it.

To summarize the difference between Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes:

| Use ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) produced from Mitochondria to use.    | Use ATP produced from a certain metabolism method, where the cell can be Heterotrophic (use organic compound and takes carbon from there) or they can be (in carbon metabolism) autotrophic which means they use CO<sub>2</sub> as their main source of carbon. Most of autotrophic bacteria are photosynthetic. In energy metabolism: it can be Phototrophic which captures light from the sun and converts it to chemical energy in the cell (most likely ATP) and Chemotrophic, where they break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy. |



Now that we know the main structure of Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, why don’t we
talk about some parts of Eukaryotes specifically? (Since Prokaryotes’ organelles
are mainly subset of those of Eukaryotes’).
The cell membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, it determines the nature of the
cell’s contact with the environment, it has a selective permeability feature which
allows it to take in required resources only. They are dynamic and flexible to allow
for passing through tight capillaries and blood-ways.
It has phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins and carbohydrates in its body to be able
to change its shape while maintaining integrity, the membrane’s thickness is
around 5-10 nanometers thick.
It’s made of a bilayer of phospholipids, embedded with proteins, carbohydrates,
glycolipids and glycoproteins and exclusively in animal cells, cholesterol; acting as
a regulator of fluidity.
Then you have the two phospholipid layers that are made of two heads and
connected with fatty acid tails, the two heads are hydrophilic and the tails are
hydrophobic (due to the tails being made of fatty acids.). The membrane is stabilized due to the hydrophobic reactions occuring.
Proteins are the second most abundant element, they serve as channels to
manage materials in or out the cell.
And you have carbohydrates bound from the outside, either with a lipid forming
glycolipids or with proteins to form glycoproteins, their function is to allow cells to
recognize each other. Cell membranes are supported by cytoskeletons to maintain
their shapes.

 ![](../assets/cellmembrane.png)
Glycoproteins mainly are used as a defensive mechanism and also allow cells to identify eachother and link up.

Glycolipids' roles are to mainly contain cell membrane stability and facilitate cellular recognition.

Polysaccharides/Oligosaccharides are a structure bound to glycoproteins and glycolipids which facilitate the ability of extracellular communication.

***Integral membrane proteins include transporters, linkers, channels, receptors and enzymes. They're mainly used for transporting materials in and out the cell, they interact with the hydrophobic part of the membrane (The tail), they're a tertiary structure (3D) and Amphipathic. They also have a specific type called transmembrane proteins which span the entire bilayer***

Peripheral membrane proteins are more concerned with regulating and anchoring other membrane components or processes at the membrane surface (Despite being loosely attached to the hydrophilic side) and it can help to respond to the signals from other cells, they are also not embedded in the bilayer.

Integrins in this phospholipid bilayer are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that bind to the extracellular matrix and attach to the extracellular ligands (protein receptors).

Cholesterol mainly controls the fluidity of the cell membrane and cell shape.

The phospholipid bilayer consists of a head and tail, the head is hydrophilic meanwhile the tails are fatty acids who are hydrophobic, ***the double bonds in the hydrophobic tails form kinks in the fatty acid tails preventing the adjacent lipids from packing tightly under the circumstance of being in a low temperature environment to preserve fluidity.***

(Under a freezing point, they tend to fracture along the hydrophobic interaction belt)

The first people who said it was a phospholipid bilayer were: E. Gorter and F. Grendel. The guys who stated there was a phospholipid bilayer with two layers of hydrophilic proteins were H. Davson and J. Danielli. 

It's now known that the fluid mosaic model has a much higher concentration of protein molecules than it was known before.

The endomembrane system (EMS) is what majorly differentiates between Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, as Eukaryotes do have an EMS meanwhile Prokaryotes don’t. The EMS consists of many parts, such as the Golgi apparatus, Lysosomes and Secretory Vesicles, most importantly the
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which is split into two types (rough
and smooth) and the nuclear envelope.

First, I’ll talk about the simpler structures, let’s take lysosomes for example, which you can also call the digestive compartment/sector of the cell, they’re a membranous sac of hydrolytic enzymes that cells use to digest macromolecules. Lysosomes have an acidic environment for its enzymes to work, if a lysosome ruptures it doesn’t damage the cell due to the neutral Ph of the cytosol, but if multiple of them rupture then it digests the cell which is the way cells protect the cells around them from a problem within one cell.

The lysosome is made through multiple steps through the rough ER and finally gets
processed in the Golgi apparatus, finally coming out as a lysosome. They carry out
digestion by different ways, protists for example eat by covering food or smaller
organisms. With a process called phagocytosis, the food vacuole formed this way and
fused with a lysosome to digest the food with its enzymes. The digestion products
become amino acids and simple sugars and spread into the cytosol, some human cells
also do cytosis such as macrophages (white blood cell type, not bacteriophages).
![](../assets/lysosomes.png)

Lysosomes also perform something called autophagy, when needed to recycle the cell’s own organic material when an organelle is damaged. Like phagocytosis, it covers the damaged organelle with a double membrane and the lysosome fuses with it, the enzymes dissolve the organelle’s membrane and breaks down the organic material, releasing it to the cytosol again for reuse.

![l](../assets/lysosomes2.png)
The endoplasmic reticulum is such a large network in the cell that it accounts for more than half the total membrane in a cell. The membranous tubules that outline and determine the shape of the ER is called the cisternae, as it’s derived from the Latin word cisterna, a reservoir for liquid. That membrane separates the internal part of the ER, called a lumen (cavity) or also called cisternal space.

There are two types of ER, although connected, differ in shape and function, which are the rough ER and the smooth ER, the rough is called so because it’s lined with ribosomes all around (responsible for protein synthesis which we’ll talk about later.)

![](../assets/er.png)
SER perform a lot of functions which vary with cell type but said functions are mainly: synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates and detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions.

The SER enzymes are the ones responsible for the creation of lipids for lipoproteins, oils and steroids and new membrane phospholipids. From said steroids are steroid hormones secreted by adrenal glands and in animal cells are the sex hormones of vertebrates.

The cells that create said sex hormones for example in the testes are rich with smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

Other enzymes help detoxify drugs and poisons, especially in liver cells. Which consists of adding Hydroxyl groups (OH-) to drug molecules making them water soluble and easier to flush through the body (get transmitted to the kidneys).

It also stores calcium ions in muscle cells, when required, the system pumps the ions through the lumen into the cytosol when the muscle is stimulated.

They could trigger contractions in the muscle or release a vesicle of a newly synthesized protein.

Humans mainly produce lipids through a certain biosynthesis method to break down and synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made that way and must be taken from food.

In animals, when there are too many carbohydrates, the excess is converted to triglycerides (fat/lipids). Which involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA (coenzyme which is notable for its role in lipid synthesis).

Rough ER (RER) on the other hand, looks almost the same as SER, has cisternae, a lumen but no tubules and has ribosomes scattered all around, which is the reason why it’s called rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomes are mainly responsible for protein synthesis for example; The proteins that make up the insulin hormone in the pancreas.

When a polypeptide chain grows from a ribosome, the chain is threaded into the RER lumen through a pore of a protein complex on the membrane wall, and it forces it to fold into the functional shape like the following for example: Ribosomes can do this by translating the genetic code in the mRNA (from nucleus) into an amino acid sequence they also use other stuff and metabolic energy to accomplish the initiation, elongation and termination of peptide synthesis.

Ribosomes mostly secrete glycoproteins (proteins with carbohydrates bonded to them). When said proteins are finished, they depart in the ER wrapped in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from an area called the transitional ER. Ribosomes are also NOT membrane bounded and thus are not considered organelles.

Ribosomes build proteins in two cytoplasmic regions at any given time, free ribosomes are ribosomes that aren't bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, these are bound in the cytosol while the bound ribosomes are attached to the RER, the two types are structurally identical, most of the proteins made by free ribosomes function in the cytosol, while bound ribosomes make proteins that are supposed to be inserted into membranes (membrane bound for membranes).

Vesicles are like transport vehicles since they transport proteins and other products from the ER through the cell.

In addition, RER is also responsible for the production of membranes in the cell, it grows in place by adding membrane proteins and phospholipids to its own membrane as polypeptides (chains of repeating amino acid units linked by a grow from the ribosomes that want to be membranes, they are inserted into the ER membrane and anchored by the hydrophobic parts (heads).

The RER also synthesizes phospholipids just like the SER enzymes in the ER assemble the lipids from nutrients and things from the cytosol, the ER cisternae expands and the product phospholipids are transferred using the vesicles to other components in the ES.![](../assets/golgi.png)
The Golgi apparatus is quite literally the warehouse of the cell, the products of the ER are transported here using vesicles and processed, and either is stored or sent to another site of a cell.

They’re extremely common in a cell which transport a lot of stuff around.

It consists of a group of associated, flattened membranous sacs (the cisternae) and the lumen (much like the ER) cisterna’s function is to separate the Golgi from the cytosol outside.

The Golgi has two sides of a stack which are referred to as the cis face and trans face, these act respectively as the receiving and delivering faces. The cis face is usually located near the ER.

Transport vesicles move the material from the ER to the Golgi apparatus the vesicle then adds its membrane and the contents of its lumen to the cis face by fusing with the Golgi membrane on that side. The Golgi mainly processes and changes things in the incoming material for example: the glycoproteins have their carbohydrates modified in the Golgi and sends it back through the trans side.

The released vesicle reaches the cell membrane and the contents are released, the vesicle’s membrane fuses with the cell membrane’s adding to its surface area.![](../assets/golgi2.png)
Vacuoles, are large vesicles in the cell, they are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, it’s very selective in transporting solutes, which causes the vacuole’s insides to be different from the cytosol’s.

Many unicellular protists that live in fresh water have contractile vacuoles that pump excess water out of the cell, therefore containing a certain concentration (ratio) of ions and molecules required in the cell.

In some fungi and plants, cells perform a task called enzymatic hydrolysis, which is a process that breaks down bonds of molecules easily using enzymes which is shared with lysosomes. ![](../assets/vacuole.png)
Some plants use the vacuoles to store proteins stockpiled in the storage cells in seeds. Vacuoles can also store poison or toxic chemicals to avoid predators, like capsaicin, it can be stored in vacuoles and exerted to deter predators who eat it.

They also have pigments that give the petals color to attract pollinating insects like bees.

Mature plant cells usually have a large central vacuole which develops from the merging of smaller vacuoles, the solution inside is called cell sap. And it deposits inorganic material in it, it also enlarges the cell by pulling in water.


The nucleus, contains most of the genes in the Eukaryotic cell, some genes are located in mitochondria and chloroplasts. The nucleus is the most conspicuous organelle and can be easily identified from inside the cell it's diameter is about 5μm. The nuclear envelope closes the figure to separate its contents from the cytoplasm.

The nuclear envelope itself is a double membrane (a bilayer bilayer) the two layers are separated by around 20-40 nanometers. The envelope is covered by pore structures that are about 100 nanometers in diameter, at the lip of each pore, the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are continuous.
An intricate protein structure called a pore complex lines each pore and functions by regulating entry and exit of proteins, RNAs and macromolecules.

The nuclear side of the envelope is lined by the *nuclear lamina* a netlike array of protein filaments (in animal cells they're called intermediate filaments) that maintain the shape of the nucleus by mechanically supporting the nuclear envelope, except at the pores.

There's also a nuclear matrix which is a framework of protein fibers extending in the nucleus' interior, both of the last two mentioned help the organization of genetic material so the cell functions efficiently.

The units in the cell are called chromosomes which are chemically composed of DNA wrapped around protein and the physical structure is two chromatids wrapped around eachother connecting at the centromere. Each chromosome contains one long DNA molecule associated with many proteins (including basic proteins called Histones which provide structural integrity (wraps the DNA around histones) for chromosomes.) The components that make up the DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes is called chromatin reticulum. The chromatin, in regular conditions (no mitosis) don't have a distinguishable shape until the cell starts splitting, it densifies with other chromatin to form one chromosome that finally become distinguishable. Each separate animal has a defined number of chromosomes, it appears as a diffuse mass when undividing.

A type of RNA (ribosomal RNA (rRNA)) is synthesized inside the nucleolus from the genes of the DNA, proteins are also imported from the cytoplasm and assembled with rRNA into large and small subunits of ribosomes, produced subunits exit the cell through the pores to the cytoplasm and they can assemble into a ribosome (probably go to the Golgi apparatus), sometimes there are two or more nucleoli in a nucleus and it depends on the species and the stage in the cell's reproductive cycle. Nucleoli also control the cell division and the life span of the cell.

The nucleus directs protein synthesis by mRNA, which is transported to the cytoplasm via nuclear pores it gets translated by ribosomes into the primary structure of a specific polypeptide.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the energy powerhouses for animal and plant cells. 
Chloroplasts, are absent in animal cells because they *cannot* perform photosynthesis, however mitochondria is present in both cells.

They convert energy to forms that cells can use for work. Mitochondria is responsible for the cell respiration as it drives the generation of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) by extracting the energy from fats, sugars and fuels. Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis in the plant cell where they perform absorption of solar energy (Sunlight) and convert it to chemical energy and using the sunlight to synthesize organic compounds like sugar and glucose from CO<sub>2</sub> and Water.

The mitochondria and chloroplasts also share evolutionary characteristics, they display similarities to bacteria which led to the *endosymbiont theory* which states that an early ancestor of eukaryotic cells (A host cell) covered over an oxygen breathing (aerobic, antonym is anaerobic) prokaryotic cell that doesn't perform photosynthesis, eventually the covered cell formed a relationship with the host cell (eukaryotic cell) becoming an *endosymbiont* which is a cell living in another cell. The evolution led to the eukaryotic cell being the parent cell and the prokaryote evolved to become the mitochondrion of the cell.

At least one of those eukaryotic cells have taken a photosynthetic prokaryote, which led to the existence of chloroplasts, this theory is consistent with many structural features of mitochondria and chloroplasts.

The theory is furthermore strengthened by the fact that the theory is consistent with many structural features of mitochondria and chloroplasts in:
1. Rather than being bounded by one membrane from the EMS it's bound by two membranes, which implies that it is in fact a prokaryotic cell inside of an Eukaryotic cells membrane, chloroplasts also have an internal system of membranous sacs.
2. Like prokaryotes, mitochondria and chloroplasts contain ribosomes as well as circular DNA molecules like bacteria's nucleoid, these program the synthesis of some organelle proteins on ribosomes that have been synthesized, and assembled in the ribosomes as well.
3.  Mitochondria and Chloroplasts are autonomous (somewhat independent from the cell) organelles that grow and reproduce inside the cell.

We'll also consider the peroxisome's evolutionary origins later.

Mitochondria is found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, including animals, plants, fungi and protists. Some cells have a single mitochondrion but more often a cell has hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria (as stated previously, mitochondria have the ability to divide).

The number correlates to the cell's level of metabolic activity for example small intestines may have a large number of mitochondria filled cells, same thing for cells that move or contract have more mitochondria per volume than less active cells.

Each of the two membranes enclosing the mitochondrion is a phospholipid bilayer, so that's two layers of phospholipid bilayers, with a unique collection of embedded proteins.
The outer membrane is smooth but the inner membrane is convoluted, with infoldings called cristae.
The inner membrane divides the mitochondrion into two internal compartments, the intermembrane space which is the space between the inner and outer membranes.
And the second compartment, the mitochondria's matrix, it's enclosed by the inner membrane, which is practically the space that the mitochondria's organelles roam in.

It has different enzymes as well as the DNA and ribosomes, the enzymes in the matrix catalyze (speed up) some steps of cellular respiration, other proteins that function in respiration including the enzymes that make ATP are produced from the ribosomes and are built in the inner membrane as highly folded surfaces. The cristae gives the inner membrane a large surface area, therefore enhancing the productivity of cellular respiration.

Mitochondria are generally in the range of 1 to 10 micro meters long, they also move around, change shapes and fuse or divide into separate fragments.

Chloroplasts, contain the green pigment *chlorophyll* which gives the plant cell and the plant in general a green color, there's another colored pigment called chromoplasts, along with enzymes and other molecules that function in the photosynthetic production of sugar, the organelle is lens shaped and about 3 to 6 micrometers in length, they're found in leaves and other green organs of plants and in algae.

The contents of the chloroplast are partitioned from the cytosol by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow intermembrane space.

Inside the chloroplast is another membranous system, in the form of flattened, interconnected sacs called thylakoids. In some regions thylakoids are stacked like poker chips (I LOVE GAMBLING!!!!!) each stack is called a granum. The fluid outside the thylakoids is the stroma, which contains the chloroplast DNA and ribosomes as well as many enzymes (this is literally just the cytosol of chloroplast).

The membranes of the chloroplast divide the chloroplast space into three compartments, the intermembrane space, the stroma and the thylakoid space. This organization enables the chloroplast to convert light energy to chemical energy.

The chloroplast, much like the mitochondria is dynamic and flexible, it can change size, grow and shrink.

They are mobile and with mitochondria and other organelles they move along the tracks of the *cytoskeleton* a structural network.

The chloroplast is a specialized member of a family of closely related plant organelles called plastids, one type of plastic is the amyloplast which is a colorless organelle that stores starch (amylose) particularly in roots and tubers, another is the chromoplast, as I said earlier.

Peroxisomes, are a metabolic compartment bounded by a single membrane which implies that it's hard that the endosymbiont theory be applied to it, because it has a single membrane.

Peroxisomes contain enzymes that remove hydrogen atoms from substrates and transfer them to oxygen producing hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct.
These reactions have different functions, some peroxisomes use oxygen to break fatty acids down to smaller molecules that are transported to mitochondria and used as fuel for cellular respiration.

Peroxisomes, much like SER detoxify alcohol and other harmful compounds by transferring hydrogen from poisonous compounds to oxygen. H2O2 is in fact toxic but the organelle contains enzymes that deconstruct it into water.

A type of peroxisomes found in plants called glyoxysomes are found in the fat storing tissues of plant seeds. They have enzymes that convert fatty acids, much like peroxisomes but directly into sugar, which the small seedling uses as a source of energy and carbon until it can produce sugar by photosynthesis.

Peroxisomes grow larger by taking in proteins made in the ER (lipids) and the cytosol.

The cytoskeleton is a network of fibers that organizes the structure and activity of the cell, they exist to help the cell mainly move and take a proper shape, scientists thought that the organelles floated freely in the cytosol, but the cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm held them in place with mechanical support.
This is especially useful for animal cells because they lack cell walls.

It has immaculate power for it's thickness, like a dome tent, cytoskeletons are stabilized by a balance between opposing forces exerted by its elements.
The cytoskeleton provides anchorage for many organelles and even cytosolic enzymes (wraps around the membranes), however the cytoskeleton is more dynamic than a normal skeleton. It can be dismantled in one part of the cell and reassembled in a new location, changing the shape of the cell.

The cell motility (change in cell & organelle position) also involves the cytoskeleton, this requires interfacing with motor proteins. Cytoskeleton filaments act like the railway of a train, while the vesicle or thing to be transported acts like the train, it has receptors where motor proteins (ATP powered) attach and move like it has legs along the filament.

The cytoskeleton also manipulates the cell membrane, bending it inward to form food vacuoles or other phagocytic vesicles.

There are 3 types of fibers that make up the cytoskeleton, Microtubules are the thickest of the three types, microfilaments (Actin filaments) are the thinnest and intermediate filaments are in the absolute middle.

To compare between animal cells and plant cells we can say that animal cells use ATP for energy (fun fact, ATP has an activator attached which is Mg++), they get provided ATP from the mitochondria, as its not photosynthetic and doesn't have chloroplast.
Meanwhile the plant cell has the chloroplast AND mitochondria to provide energy to the cell through sugar compounds, it has chloroplast to make its own food and mitochondria for regular plant breathing.

Animal cells communicate with neighboring cells through cell junctions and glycoproteins & glycolipids, meanwhile plant cells have a cell wall which unfortunately breaks contact,, BUTTT they have something called plasmodesmata that pass through the connecting cell walls.

The nucleus lies on one side of the cell in the plant cell, but in an animal cell it lies in the middle, as also stated before, mitochondria exist in plant cells but they're fewer in number, in animal cells they're large in number.
Plastids are present in plant cells meanwhile absent in animal cells, plant cells also lack centrosomes which causes them to use their cell membrane through condensation to make spindle fibers for cell mitosis or meiosis, meanwhile in an animal cell, centrosomes are present which go to the two poles of the cell and extend spindle fibers.

A large central vacuole for food and everything exists in plant cells, meanwhile in animal cells, smaller unmerged vacuoles exist.

As known, plant cells have a certain shape due to the cell wall and animal cells have an irregular shape, their sizes respectively are around 10-100 micrometers and 10-30 micrometers, only animal cells have something such as cilia or flagella, plants also lack cholesterol in cell membranes.

Plant cells also store excess glucose or sugar as starch, while animal cells store glucose as glycogen in the liver (using the glucagon hormone from the pancreas.).

# Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis, also known as the "white plague" or historically known as consumption is an infectious disease which is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Koch's Bacillus) bacteria. It generally affects the lungs and digs cavities inside it, it also can affect other parts of the body.

It spreads through the air when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes, spits or even speaks, so it's an infectious, air transmitted disease. The infection starts off with a stage called Primary TB infection. where the immune system finds the cells and germs and starts to kill them, it may completely destroy the germs but some germs might still survive and multiply, people don't usually get symptoms in this stage, but if it's slightly severe they get an emergency response from their body such as: low fever, fatigue and a cough.

The stage that follows is called latent TB infection, in which case it shows no symptoms and lies dormant in the body because the immune system builds a wall around lung tissue with the TB germs, they cannot do any harm if they're kept under control but the germs survive. But around 10% of them evolve into active disease that, if left untreated kills about half of those affected by latent TB.

Active TB is the stage after latent TB with a delay of months or years or after the primary TB directly, it happens when the immune system can't control the infection, the germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body, its symptoms include: Coughing, coughing up blood or mucus, chest pain, pain with breathing or coughing, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, not wanting to eat, fatigue and not feeling well. All of the previous happen in the lungs and other parts of the body (lung TB is called pulmonary TB).

The infection sites could be in the larynx, kidneys, liver, fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord, heart muscles, genitals, lymph nodes, bones and joints, skin and walls of blood vessels.

The risk factors are mainly smoking and HIV/AIDS because this heavily impacts the immune system, Tuberculosis mainly causes huge cavities and decay of the lungs, such as the following image.![](../assets/Cavitary_tuberculosis.jpg)
These cavities are identified through X-rays as well as microscopic examination and culture of bodily fluids, while for latent TB it relies on a tuberculin skin test (TST) which is also called the Mantoux test is a tool for diagnosing and screening TB, a standard dose of 5 tuberculin (protein) units is injected on the intradermal flexor surface of the left forearm, midway between elbow and wrist, an inflammation happens in the area in a delayed time and the redness is measured where 5mm of redness has certain criteria and so does 10 and 15. or blood tests instead of the Mantoux test.

A person who's taking tuberculosis treatment meds can't transmit the disease after 2 to 3 weeks.

Some forms of TB have become drug resistant, which means that drugs that once cured the disease no longer work.

It mainly targets all ages, under 5 years they have a high risk of TB becoming active TB, the risk is greater for ages < 2. Tuberculosis causes some serious damage during this stage, such as brain and spinal cord fluid damage.
Ages 15 to 25, have a higher chance to develop more severe ATB.
65 or older, have a higher risk and it may be even harder to treat.

TB treatment can be done by the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) where infants are often vaccinated by this which protects infants and toddlers who are more likely to have active TB, although this may not protect against the disease in the lungs.

TB prevention can be 2 things: you may need to take drugs to prevent latent TB from becoming active TB or in the case of it being active then you must prevent the spreading of the disease, you should take the drugs or meds for four, six or nine months.
During the first two or three weeks you'll be able to pass the TB to others, protect them by staying home, isolating yourself and ventilating the room, wear masks and covering your mouth during coughing, don't spit or talk near other people.

It may also cause a firm red or purple swelling under the skin, cause urine to contain blood, headaches or confusion, back pain and hoarseness.

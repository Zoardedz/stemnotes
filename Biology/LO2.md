- **Prokaryotic & Eukaryotic cells**

Cells, are the smallest building unit of life, they are split into two types: Prokaryotic cells and Eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes are called so due to the *Greek* derivation **“<font color="#4f81bd">before nucleus</font>”** while Eukaryotic means **“<font color="#4bacc6">true nucleus</font>”**.

To start off, we’ll talk about <em><font color="#f79646">Prokaryotic cells</font></em> since they’re the smaller brother of <em><font color="#f79646">Eukaryotic cells</font></em>, they’re way smaller than Eukaryotic cells and are way simpler, they’re all unicellular, *they don’t have a nucleus*, unlike eukaryotes, (*represented in the opposite figure*), the DNA is just floating about in the cytoplasm. The DNA in the following bacteria (prokaryote) is called circular DNA (note that DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic acid).

![[Pasted image 20241020221011.png]]

In normal eukaryotes, DNA is more *linear* (*called linear chromosomes, it can also take the form of circular molecules*), Prokaryotes are mostly things like bacterium and archaea, prokaryotes mostly reproduce through ***binary fission*** since they don’t have ***centrosomes or a nucleus** like a regular Eukaryote.* 

![[Pasted image 20241020221342.png]]

***Prokaryotes*** mainly consist of no *nucleus* although it’s substituted area is called *nucleoid*, *cytoplasm (non-distinctive), plasmids (non-distinctive), a capsule, cell wall, outside pill lining (fimbriae) and flagellum (all of the previous are distinctive).* ***They also lack chloroplast and mitochondria or any membrane organelle, as they don’t have an endomembrane system. (they only have cell membrane)***.

Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand are relatively bigger in size as shown in the figure below.

They are multicellular (such as human cells and plant cells) AND unicellular (such as protists (Euglena and Paramecium for example)).

These cells have an actual organelle (component of cell) to contain the DNA called the nucleus, it contains all genetic information and is responsible for releasing RNA into the cytoplasm.

RNA is short for Ribonucleic acid, which is a polymer that is essential for most biological functions, it either performs the function itself (*non-coding RNA*) or by forming a template for other things to follow after for example for the production of proteins, it makes a certain amino acid structure that can be used as a base (messenger RNA (mRNA)) (which gets read by a ribosome throughout protein synthesis) 

it has pores for it to transport said RNA, they have actual centrosomes for a proper way of performing mitosis rather than doing binary fission, they can split into 2 cells using the centrosome.

Most Eukaryotes majorly lack the components that make Prokaryotes versatile and movable, however something like Euglena do have a flagellum. Plasmids are also present in some cases, although not here. Eukaryotes have chloroplasts, mitochondria, and an entire endomembrane system which differentiates it a lot from a regular prokaryote. We’ll talk about Eukaryotes’ internal structure in more detail. For now, just know that Prokaryotes only have the necessities like Ribosomes for proteins, Nucleoids for replication and other defining details. Both of them also have an area called cytosol (difference is that it doesn’t line the plasma membrane) while cytosol has organelles floating in it.

To summarize the difference between Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes:

In energy metabolism: it can be Phototrophic which captures light from the sun and converts it to chemical energy in the cell (most likely ATP) and Chemotrophic, where they break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy. |



Now that we know the main structure of Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, why don’t we
talk about some parts of Eukaryotes specifically? (Since Prokaryotes’ organelles
are mainly subset of those of Eukaryotes’).
The cell membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, it determines the nature of the
cell’s contact with the environment, it has a selective permeability feature which
allows it to take in required resources only. They are dynamic and flexible to allow
for passing through tight capillaries and blood-ways.
It has phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins and carbohydrates in its body to be able
to change its shape while maintaining integrity, the membrane’s thickness is
around 5-10 nanometers thick.
It’s made of a bilayer of phospholipids, embedded with proteins, carbohydrates,
glycolipids and glycoproteins and exclusively in animal cells, cholesterol; acting as
a regulator of fluidity.
Then you have the two phospholipid layers that are made of two heads and
connected with fatty acid tails, the two heads are hydrophilic and the tails are
hydrophobic (due to the tails being made of fatty acids.)
Proteins are the second most abundant element, they serve as channels to
manage materials in or out the cell.
And you have carbohydrates bound from the outside, either with a lipid forming
glycolipids or with proteins to form glycoproteins, their function is to allow cells to
recognize each other. Cell membranes are supported by cytoskeletons to maintain
their shapes.

 ![[Pasted image 20241021193136.png]]
Glycoproteins mainly are used as a defensive mechanism and also allow cells to identify eachother and link up.

Glycolipids' roles are to mainly contain cell membrane stability and facilitate cellular recognition.

Integral membrane proteins include transporters, linkers, channels, receptors and enzymes. They're mainly used for transporting materials in and out the cell, they interact with the hydrophobic part of the membrane (The tail).

Peripheral membrane proteins are more concerned with regulating and anchoring other membrane components or processes at the membrane surface (Despite being loosely attached to the hydrophilic side)

Cholesterol mainly controls the fluidity of the cell membrane and cell shape.

The phospholipid bilayer consists of a head and tail, the head is hydrophilic meanwhile the tails are fatty acids who are hydrophobic.

The endomembrane system (EMS) is what majorly differentiates between Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, as Eukaryotes do have an EMS meanwhile Prokaryotes don’t. The EMS consists of many parts, such as the Golgi apparatus, Lysosomes and Secretory Vesicles, most importantly the
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which is split into two types (rough
and smooth) and the nuclear envelope.

First, I’ll talk about the simpler structures, let’s take lysosomes for example, which you can also call the digestive compartment/sector of the cell, they’re a membranous sac of hydrolytic enzymes that cells use to digest macromolecules. Lysosomes have an acidic environment for its enzymes to work, if a lysosome ruptures it doesn’t damage the cell due to the neutral Ph of the cytosol, but if multiple of them rupture then it digests the cell which is the way cells protect the cells around them from a problem within one cell.

The lysosome is made through multiple steps through the rough ER and finally gets
processed in the Golgi apparatus, finally coming out as a lysosome. They carry out
digestion by different ways, protists for example eat by covering food or smaller
organisms. With a process called phagocytosis, the food vacuole formed this way and
fused with a lysosome to digest the food with its enzymes. The digestion products
become amino acids and simple sugars and spread into the cytosol, some human cells
also do cytosis such as macrophages (white blood cell type, not bacteriophages).
![[Pasted image 20241021220346.png]]

Lysosomes also perform something called autophagy, when needed to recycle the cell’s own organic material when an organelle is damaged. Like phagocytosis, it covers the damaged organelle with a double membrane and the lysosome fuses with it, the enzymes dissolve the organelle’s membrane and breaks down the organic material, releasing it to the cytosol again for reuse.

![[Pasted image 20241021230428.png]]
The endoplasmic reticulum is such a large network in the cell that it accounts for more than half the total membrane in a cell. The membranous tubules that outline and determine the shape of the ER is called the cisternae, as it’s derived from the Latin word cisterna, a reservoir for liquid. That membrane separates the internal part of the ER, called a lumen (cavity) or also called cisternal space.

There are two types of ER, although connected, differ in shape and function, which are the rough ER and the smooth ER, the rough is called so because it’s lined with ribosomes all around (responsible for protein synthesis which we’ll talk about later.)

![[Pasted image 20241021230514.png]]
SER perform a lot of functions which vary with cell type but said functions are mainly: synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates and detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions.

The SER enzymes are the ones responsible for the creation of lipids for lipoproteins, oils and steroids and new membrane phospholipids. From said steroids are steroid hormones secreted by adrenal glands and in animal cells are the sex hormones of vertebrates.

The cells that create said sex hormones for example in the testes are rich with smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

Other enzymes help detoxify drugs and poisons, especially in liver cells. Which consists of adding Hydroxyl groups (OH-) to drug molecules making them water soluble and easier to flush through the body (get transmitted to the kidneys).

It also stores calcium ions in muscle cells, when required, the system pumps the ions through the lumen into the cytosol when the muscle is stimulated.

They could trigger contractions in the muscle or release a vesicle of a newly synthesized protein.

Humans mainly produce lipids through a certain biosynthesis method to break down and synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made that way and must be taken from food.

In animals, when there are too many carbohydrates, the excess is converted to triglycerides (fat/lipids). Which involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA (coenzyme which is notable for its role in lipid synthesis).

Rough ER (RER) on the other hand, looks almost the same as SER, has cisternae, a lumen but no tubules and has ribosomes scattered all around, which is the reason why it’s called rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomes are mainly responsible for protein synthesis for example; The proteins that make up the insulin hormone in the pancreas.

When a polypeptide chain grows from a ribosome, the chain is threaded into the RER lumen through a pore of a protein complex on the membrane wall, and it forces it to fold into the functional shape like the following for example: Ribosomes can do this by translating the genetic code in the mRNA (from nucleus) into an amino acid sequence they also use other stuff and metabolic energy to accomplish the initiation, elongation and termination of peptide synthesis.

Ribosomes mostly secrete glycoproteins (proteins with carbohydrates bonded to them). When said proteins are finished, they depart in the ER wrapped in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from an area called the transitional ER. Ribosomes are also NOT membrane bounded and thus are not considered organelles.

Ribosomes build proteins in two cytoplasmic regions at any given time, free ribosomes are ribosomes that aren't bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, these are bound in the cytosol while the bound ribosomes are attached to the RER, the two types are structurally identical, most of the proteins made by free ribosomes function in the cytosol, while bound ribosomes make proteins that are supposed to be inserted into membranes (membrane bound for membranes).

Vesicles are like transport vehicles since they transport proteins and other products from the ER through the cell.

In addition, RER is also responsible for the production of membranes in the cell, it grows in place by adding membrane proteins and phospholipids to its own membrane as polypeptides (chains of repeating amino acid units linked by a grow from the ribosomes that want to be membranes, they are inserted into the ER membrane and anchored by the hydrophobic parts (heads).

The RER also synthesizes phospholipids just like the SER enzymes in the ER assemble the lipids from nutrients and things from the cytosol, the ER cisternae expands and the product phospholipids are transferred using the vesicles to other components in the ES.![[Pasted image 20241021231559.png]]
The Golgi apparatus is quite literally the warehouse of the cell, the products of the ER are transported here using vesicles and processed, and either is stored or sent to another site of a cell.

They’re extremely common in a cell which transport a lot of stuff around.

It consists of a group of associated, flattened membranous sacs (the cisternae) and the lumen (much like the ER) cisterna’s function is to separate the Golgi from the cytosol outside.

The Golgi has two sides of a stack which are referred to as the cis face and trans face, these act respectively as the receiving and delivering faces. The cis face is usually located near the ER.

Transport vesicles move the material from the ER to the Golgi apparatus the vesicle then adds its membrane and the contents of its lumen to the cis face by fusing with the Golgi membrane on that side. The Golgi mainly processes and changes things in the incoming material for example: the glycoproteins have their carbohydrates modified in the Golgi and sends it back through the trans side.

The released vesicle reaches the cell membrane and the contents are released, the vesicle’s membrane fuses with the cell membrane’s adding to its surface area.![[Pasted image 20241021231614.png]]
Vacuoles, are large vesicles in the cell, they are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, it’s very selective in transporting solutes, which causes the vacuole’s insides to be different from the cytosol’s.

Many unicellular protists that live in fresh water have contractile vacuoles that pump excess water out of the cell, therefore containing a certain concentration (ratio) of ions and molecules required in the cell.

In some fungi and plants, cells perform a task called enzymatic hydrolysis, which is a process that breaks down bonds of molecules easily using enzymes which is shared with lysosomes.![[Pasted image 20241021231828.png]]
Some plants use the vacuoles to store proteins stockpiled in the storage cells in seeds. Vacuoles can also store poison or toxic chemicals to avoid predators, like capsaicin, it can be stored in vacuoles and exerted to deter predators who eat it.

They also have pigments that give the petals color to attract pollinating insects like bees.

Mature plant cells usually have a large central vacuole which develops from the merging of smaller vacuoles, the solution inside is called cell sap. And it deposits inorganic material in it, it also enlarges the cell by pulling in water.


The nucleus, contains most of the genes in the Eukaryotic cell, some genes are located in mitochondria and chloroplasts. The nucleus is the most conspicuous organelle and can be easily identified from inside the cell it's diameter is about 5μm. The nuclear envelope closes the figure to separate its contents from the cytoplasm.

The nuclear envelope itself is a double membrane (a bilayer bilayer) the two layers are separated by around 20-40 nanometers. The envelope is covered by pore structures that are about 100 nanometers in diameter, at the lip of each pore, the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are continuous.
An intricate protein structure called a pore complex lines each pore and functions by regulating entry and exit of proteins, RNAs and macromolecules. 
![[Pasted image 20241022150819.png]]

The nuclear side of the envelope is lined by the *nuclear lamina* a netlike array of protein filaments (in animal cells they're called intermediate cells) that maintain the shape of the nucleus by mechanically supporting the nuclear envelope.

There's also a nuclear matrix which is a framework of protein fibers extending in the nucleus' interior, both of the last two mentioned help the organization of genetic material so the cell functions efficiently.

The units in the cell are called chromosomes which are chemically composed of DNA wrapped around protein and the physical structure is two chromatids wrapped around eachother connecting at the centromere. Each chromosome contains one long DNA molecule associated with many proteins (including basic proteins called Histones which provide structural integrity (wraps the DNA around histones) for chromosomes.) The components that make up the DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes is called chromatin reticulum. The chromatin, in regular conditions (no mitosis) don't have a distinguishable shape until the cell starts splitting, it densifies with other chromatin to form one chromosome that finally become distinguishable. Each separate animal has a defined number of chromosomes.

A type of RNA (ribosomal RNA (rRNA)) is synthesized inside the nucleolus from the genes of the DNA, proteins are also imported from the cytoplasm and assembled with rRNA into large and small subunits of ribosomes, produced subunits exit the cell through the pores to the cytoplasm and they can assemble into a ribosome (probably go to the Golgi apparatus), sometimes there are two or more nucleoli in a nucleus and it depends on the species and the stage in the cell's reproductive cycle. Nucleoli also control the cell division and the life span of the cell.

The nucleus directs protein synthesis by mRNA, which is transported to the cytoplasm via nuclear pores it gets translated by ribosomes into the primary structure of a specific polypeptide.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the energy powerhouses for animal and plant cells. 
Chloroplasts, are absent in animal cells because they *cannot* perform photosynthesis, however mitochondria is present in both cells.

They convert energy to forms that cells can use for work. Mitochondria is responsible for the cell respiration as it drives the generation of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) by extracting the energy from fats, sugars and fuels. Chloroplast are the site of photosynthesis in the plant cell where they perform

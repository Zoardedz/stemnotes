**Atoms**

·      Greek philosophers imagined that there’s a possibility of dividing a piece of matter smaller and smaller till reaching an undividable fragment, which they called an atom (“a” meaning no and “tom” meaning division).

·      Democritus (400 B.C) called nature’s basic particle an atom, followed:

·      Aristotle (4th century B.C) rejected that concept and said that all matter is made up of four essential things, “Earth, Fire, Water and Air” and they believed that they could change cheap metals into expensive ones like gold. He thought all matter was continuous and divides forever, his idea was accepted for a very long time.

·      Boyle (Irish scientist, circa 1661) refused Aristotle’s idea and defined the element as: “A pure simple substance that cannot be changed to simpler forms by the traditional chemical methods.”, He observed that with quantitative experiments.

·      Lavoisier (French) was like Boyle, he made experiments and regarded measurement as the essential operation of chemistry. He suggested, in his experiments that mass is neither created nor destroyed and saw that during reactions there was a definite ratio, he called this the law of conservation of mass. He also published the Elementary Treatise on Chemistry. He also classified elements into metallic and non-metallic.

·      Proust (French) showed that a compound always contains the same mass ratio between its elements, where water can be: 8/9 oxygen, this is known as the law of definite proportion.

·      Dalton (English) thought about atoms as particles that compose elements, however he discovered something that made him believe atoms more which he named the multiple proportions law. He formulated a theory that states: 1. Each element is made up of tiny particles called atoms. 2. The atoms of a given element are identical, atoms of different elements are different, can be similar but not identical (referring to isotopes). 3. Chemical compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine one another and they have the same relative numbers and types of atoms. 4. Chemical reactions change the way atoms are bound together and reorganizes them and not the atoms themselves. He prepared a periodic table based off of atomic masses like Mendeleev except that it wasn’t really accurate.

·      ![](file:///C:/Users/ISLAPT~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png)Thomson (English) he made an experiment using tubes sending electrical charges with relatively no pressure and called these tubes “cathode-ray tubes.” He postulated that the beam originates from the negative pole (cathode) hence the name due to an obvious observation, he hypothesized that electrons would be negative due to emerging from the cathode and expelling, it was known that the atom is neutral, so he knew there had to be some positive charge in the atom. He thought that electrons were around a cloud of positive charges, he compared it to a pudding with raisins on it (plum pudding).

·      ![](file:///C:/Users/ISLAPT~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.jpg)Millikan (English) He used an apparatus to charge and ionize the air around oil droplets with two positive and negative poles, he used the attraction the oil droplets made to determine their charge and mass.

·      Henri Becquerel (French) found out that Uranium produced its image on a Polaroid-type film with no light, he attributed this to spontaneous emission of radiation rays that he called radioactivity, studies found out that there was gamma (![[clip_image004.png]]) rays (high energy, neutral), alpha (![[clip_image006.png]]) particles (+2 charge, 7294x the mass of an electron) and beta (![[clip_image008.png]]) particles (high speed electron (negative or positive charge).

·      Rutherford (Australian) He made an experiment where he shot alpha particles into a gold foil sheet to see if it’d pass through, most of the particles passed through due to a void between the gold molecules, but when it deflected and hit a gold molecule, it deflected with a great angle, from which Rutherford was able to deduce that the plum pudding model was simply, incorrect because the alpha particle probably passed through the empty space in an atom which is the major amount of alpha particles without deflection, also because some particles deflected a little, he deduced that the positive charge in an atom is concentrated in a very small volume of an atom, which he deduced from the very few alpha particles that did a large angle’s deflection. He proposed an atomic model, much like the modern shape, the positive charge and most of the mass, were concentrated in the middle which he called the nucleus, and around it were negative particles (electrons) revolving at very high speeds due to the strong charge difference causing an electrostatic attraction in a circular path.

·      Bohr (Danish) Proposed a new model in 1915, he proposed that electrons do not radiate energy as they revolve the nucleus, but exist in states of constant energy that he called stationary states, which means, they have a fixed distance from the nucleus (Energy levels hint), he based this on the emission spectra of hydrogen, he found that if an electron could move into different orbits/energy levels, if they have energy (Quantum). If it loses this energy, it returns back to its original energy, releasing said quantum as a photon or quantum of light, this was his basis for the quantum theory, according to his planetary model, the electrons circle around the nucleus of the atom in orbits, when it is in fact, in an orbit, it has fixed energy, the further the electron gets from the nucleus the more energy it has (such as Cesium).

**Atomic Structure**

As Bohr had stated, the atom does in fact, have energy levels and they have electrons revolving around their nucleus, the nucleus’ mass is 1836 times that of an electron, a proton and neutron are nearly equal in mass, which has most of the atom’s weight. The radius of a typical is around 1 to 2.5 Angstroms, whereas the radius of the nucleus is about 10^-5 Angstroms, the number of protons in a nucleus is known as the atomic number Z.

The nucleus consists of protons(+) and neutrons(![[clip_image010.png]]), meanwhile electrons(–) revolve around it which makes the atom electrically neutral, the actual reason that electrons revolve around the nucleus is magnetism and electricity, where protons are positive and electrons are negative so the electrons in result, whirl around the nucleus.

There’s a measuring unit in relation to Dalton called the atomic mass unit, it’s also known as Dalton (Da) or unified atomic mass unit (u) the AMU is defined as 1/12 the mass of an atom of carbon-12

          The number of protons in an atom never change, which could be taken as a UUID for the element, meanwhile an atom can gain or lose electrons which are called valence electrons, neutrons can also change which in this case it’s called an isotope. The mass number can be written as a superscript to the element name and atomic number is a subscript to the element name.

Reactions, change the way the atoms are arranged to form a new composition that has a different composition.

Atoms could have really similar properties which cause them to be derived under certain names such as the following:

·      Isotopes

·      Isobars

·      Isotones

·      Isoelectrons

**Isotopes**

Each element has a definite number of protons, varying number of electrons and neutrons, isotopes, especially differ in the neutrons part, they have the same chemical properties but differ in atomic mass, so they have different physical properties. Isotopes can differ from one another where one of them can be a stable isotope that’s fine and happy with its neutrons, but sometimes, an atom can have a bit too many neutrons than it can handle that it goes radioactive and starts emitting particles, rays as forms of radiation. Said isotopes are called radioisotopes.

Any isotope/atom in general with a mass number/atomic number greater than that of Bismuth’s (![[clip_image012.png]] is immediately a radioactive nuclide.

Radioactive elements emit radiation in the form of particles and rays such as: alpha, beta and gamma ![[clip_image014.png]], relative atomic mass of an element is the average mass of an atom and it takes into account the masses of each isotope and their proportions in the environment.

          To calculate the relative atomic mass, you should have, the abundance of each isotope which tells you the quantity the isotope is present in the environment and the mass number of each isotope of an element.

For example:

Ar = ![[clip_image018.png]] =35.5u

**Isotones**

Isotones are nuclides of different chemical elements, they have the same neutron number, different proton and electron numbers.

Such as **Boron-12 and carbon-13** as they both have 7 neutrons in both nuclides. (take the n as neutrons)

**Isobars**

Isobars are nuclides that have different chemical elements (necessary for any iso- prefix, isotopes are a special case) that have the mass number/atomic weight/nucleon number, with different atomic numbers.

**Isoelectronic**

They are different elements having the same number of electrons, this can never be achieved at a normal state atom, it only happens between an ion and an ion or a normal atom.

**Alpha particles**

   A particle that carries a positive charge of two, where the particle itself is two protons and two neutrons tightly bound together, it forms as a type of radioactive decay, even though it’s the least penetrating (can barely penetrate paper), it’s the most ionizing due to it’s charge which means that it causes the most harm, they’re 7294x the mass of an electron, the particle is identical to the helium-4’s nucleon. Mass of particles and rays is directly proportional to its ionizing power, so alpha is the greatest but also inversely proportional to its penetration power because it increases the chances to collide with another molecule therefore not being able to penetrate deeply. Interestingly enough, if two alpha particles collide, it causes a gamma ray to be produced from excited nuclear states of the compound 8Be, at the same time if a negative beta and a positive alpha particle collide they produce deuterium, when it collides with an atom it provides a large amount of energy to a singular electron, which could potentially make it jump an energy level or two, they’re so not penetrating that they stop travelling through air at 10 to 18cms, it’s decay equation is about: ![[clip_image021.png]], for example: ![[clip_image023.png]]

**Beta particles**

Beta particles, on the other hand, can carry two charges, not at once but at times, they can carry a negative charge and be called an electron (from how close it is to the structure of an electron) or carry a positive charge and be called a positron, they can break down from a radioactive element’s neutron causing it to produce an antineutrino, the decomposition equation can be noted as ![[clip_image025.png]]. Its mass is **1/1837** that of a proton, which means that it has relatively smaller mass, in result a lesser ionization ability, therefore a greater penetration ability and speed, which means that it can penetrate paper, aluminum and causes long term effects as burns and such. When a beta particle collides with an atom in a way, it’s lost energy due to said collision is released as a low energy x-ray. Beta particles can penetrate meters into air and a smaller unit in skin and metal.

**Gamma rays**

Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation (EMR) like x-rays, except that gamma rays are emitted from an excited nucleus rather than energy loss, it either returns to its stable state or continues being excited until it becomes stable again, they can be also a side-product of a beta particle when it doesn’t get rid of the extra energy, the nucleus releases a gamma ray. It carries no charge since it has the properties of a wave and is in fact a high energy photon, it’s very fast (electromagnetic speeds, 3*10^8), with low mass, high penetration and low ionization.

Its decay equation is: ![[clip_image027.png]] where * denotes an excited atom. It can penetrate through almost everything except a high thickness of a lead or concrete wall.

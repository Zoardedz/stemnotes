> # RADIOACTIVITY

As well known, radioactivity was discovered by Henri Becquerel when he left his office for the day with a piece of Uranium in a spot away from fluorescent filament of which after he came back the following day, he saw that the Uranium had left effect on it despite the Uranium being in a drawer. How could this be? Becquerel thought that the Uranium had more behind it, which is what inspired him to continue his research, he thought that invisible rays were coming out of it which was in reality wrong.

What's actually happening here? The reason a Uranium chunk was spewing out these "invisible" rays is due to its de-stabilization, as I mentioned in one of my previous files, when an atom has more mass number than that of Bismuth, it turns into a radioactive isotope, which constantly tries to lose its own neutrons to achieve a stable composition, these reactions are calling ***nuclear fission reactions*** where the nuclide keeps losing many parts of its nucleus until it reaches the desired stable composition. Also, when an object's atomic number reaches furthermore 84 it becomes unstable with respect to radioactive decay.

Now, the reason I put invisible in quotes is because the rays or ***particles*** emitted aren't actually invisible, they're just too miniscule to be seen by the naked eye, these particles vary from alpha particles, beta particles and to electromagnetic waves, the E.M waves mostly range from Ultraviolet to Gamma Rays in the electromagnetic spectrum.

Nuclei of nuclides are quite small compared to the radius of the entire atom, which is about 10^-10 meters. Nuclei are also dense in bulk matter, literally averaging about 1.8x10<sup>14</sup>gm/cm<sup>3</sup>. If earth's density was the same density as the nuclear density, its radius would be around 200m (note that the area of the earth is the area of an ellipsoid (3D ellipse), not a sphere). 

Now let's talk about nuclear equations, let's compare between them and regular chemical equations, if a chemical equation is described, we can describe it as the rearrangements of the reactants to form new bonds in the products. Here in nuclear equations, they're not the same, the rearrangements or process going on causes changes in the reactants causing it to produce subatomic particles in the products (neutrons, protons or particles such as beta, alpha particles and electromagnetic waves, as previously mentioned.). Nuclear equations also follow conservation laws, where they're balanced in two ways: 
1. The sum of the mass numbers of the reactants must be equal to the sum of the mass numbers of the products.
2. The sum of the charges of the reactants equals the sum of the charges of the products.
We can use the conservation laws to find the atomic mass and atomic number for the nuclide of a product from a nuclear reaction, for example if a Magnesium-25 atom reacts with an $\alpha$ particle it produces a proton and a nuclide ($_Z^AX$) where X is the unknown element, Z is often referred to as the atomic number and A is the atomic mass.
$_{12}^{25}Mg$+$_2^4He$ = $_1^1H$ + $_Z^AX$
Sum all the mass numbers for them to be equal in the reactants and products:
25+4 = 1+A, therefore A = 28
Do the same for the atomic number
12 + 2 = 1 + Z, therefore Z = 13, therefore this element is Aluminum.

Let's take another example for an Iodine-125, if it reacts with an electron and produces no new massive particles, only a nuclide, what's the equation?
Now, electrons have a negative charge, therefore they should be written as: $_{-1}^{0}e$ 
The reaction: $_{53}^{125}I + _{-1}^{0}e \rightarrow _{52}^{125}Te$.
Since we decrease one from the atomic number, we get a different element, as I had previously mentioned in LO4, an element is defined or known by its atomic number as it's the UUID for it.

There are two types for nuclear reactions, nuclear decay reactions and nuclear transmutation reactions, in a nuclear decay reaction, the high energy high mass radioactive isotope is constantly trying to lose energy and mass so it emits subatomic particles constantly.
In contrary, the transmutation reactions or nuclear fusion reactions is when a nucleus reacts with a subatomic particle or another nucleus to form a product nucleus that is more massive than the starting material. Nuclear decay reactions (fission) spontaneously occur to reach a more stable composition, meanwhile fusion reactions occur in very special cases.

Fission reactions occur by a subatomic particle slamming into a large atom that excites it very much causing it to have energy such that it decomposes the energy and decays instantaneously.

Some reactions undergo modes of decay mainly with particles or doing something that causes these particles to be emitted, described in the following image:

Add to the previous modes of decay, neutron capture which is when a neutron strikes an atom, a Uranium atom for example (a gigantic nuclide) and ***DOES NOT CAUSE A FUSION REACTION***, rather, it causes a spontaneous fission reaction.
# Nuclear Fission Reactions

Nuclear fission reactions are reactions that break elements with high ratios between neutrons and protons, they can go spontaneous fission, in which the nucleus breaks into two pieces that have different atomic numbers and atomic masses. This process is important for the transactinide elements, with Z (mass number) greater than or equal to 104. Fission is usually accompanied by the release of large amounts of energy and neutrons, for example the fission of: $^{254}_{98}Cf$ into $^{118}_{46}Pd+^{132}_{52}Te+4^1_0n$ (obviously following the rules previously mentioned that were needed for the nuclear reactions).

Elements undergo fission reactions till they reach the end of the ***radioactive decay series*** which is what an element produces when it decays with alpha particles or beta particles until it reaches the most stable composition. 
For example, the radioactive decay series for Uranium-238 ![Radioactivedecayseries](Radioactivedecayseries.png)

# Nuclear Fusion Reactions (Induced Nuclear Reactions)

	In the late 19th century, it showed that some nuclei spontaneously transform into nuclei with a different number of protons, therefore, producing a new element. 
From the previous statement, scientists were able to realize that in-principle, it should be possible to carry out the reverse action and convert a stable nucleus to another massive one by bombarding it with subatomic particles during a nuclear transmutation reaction.

For example: Rutherford conducted that $\alpha$ particles emitted by radium could react with nitrogen to produce oxygen and a proton, he found that there is a trend among light target elements (light nuclides) where the atomic number increases by 1 and the mass number increases by 3 when a light nucleus is bombarded with alpha particles, the result nuclide also accompanies a proton.

Very light elements such as Li, Be, and B reacted differently, they would emit a different type of radiation it was highly penetrating radiation rather than a proton, it started releasing neutrons which wasn't affected by magnetic or electrical fields, Rutherford described them as a neutral particle that was similar to the mass of the proton. For these light elements, if you bombard them with alpha particles, they produce a nuclide with the same mass number increase but with an atomic number increase of two, it also accompanies a neutron rather than a proton. Because $\alpha$ and atomic nuclei are both positively charged, they're repelled by eachother therefore the only alpha particles that can actually cause induced nuclear reactions are the ones travelling at high speeds.
However, as previously mentioned, Neutrons are easier to bombard atoms with, as they're neutral, therefore they don't have a problem with affecting the nucleus. From which carbon-14 is naturally formed from in the atmosphere.

Any isotope capable of undergoing a nuclear fission reaction when bombarded with neutrons is called a fissile isotope. When these isotopes are bombarded with relatively low energy neutrons, they become extremely unstable nuclides and as a result, immediately undergo fission (spontaneous fission).

Lastly, it's also a little important to note that the radioactive atom asymmetrically divides rather into two equal parts. 

# Transuranium elements and their synthesis

Transuranium elements are the elements that are heavier than Uranium which is the heaviest naturally occurring element where its Z = 92, elements whose atomic number (Z) is higher than 92 are called transuranium elements and never naturally occur and are synthesized in labs by bombarding suitable target nuclei with smaller particles, the first transuranium element to be prepared was Neptunium Z=93 , which was synthesized in 1940 by bombarding a Uranium-238 target chunk with neutrons, which lead it to cause an induced nuclear reaction but at the stage where it turns into Uranium-239 the atom becomes too unstable and immediately fissions into Neptunium-239 and a $\beta$ particle. The devices used for these procedures are called particle accelerators and are extremely dangerous to be around.

# Half-life

The half-life of a radioactive isotope is when the yield mass of the radioactive isotope halves over a certain amount of time, the amount remaining can be calculated where the amount remaining = initial amount x $(\dfrac{1}{2})^n$ where n is the number of half lives, this expression works even if the number of half-lives isn't an integer number.

The rate of decay for these isotopes is achieved through $t_{\dfrac{1}{2}}= \dfrac{ln(2)}{k} = \dfrac{0.693}{k}$ where k is the rate of decay in hours. k is a constant across radioactive elements. This is achieved through the first-order kinetics formula where it depends on the slope continually decreases as time progresses until it reaches zero.

# Strong forces and Nuclear Binding Energy

The nuclear binding energy is calculated through Einstein's equation, $E=mc^2$ as it's the only way to convert between mass and energy. To achieve the mass, the mass of the protons, neutrons and electrons must be known, for example, to calculate the nuclear binding energy for a Helium atom, we must add the masses where the mass of a proton is 1.0073amus, neutrons are 1.0087amus, electrons are 0.00055amus, negligible mass but must be considered. these are summed into the mass of the entire atom. When you add all of these up, they're not the same mass as an actual Helium atom (4.0026amus). This is due to something known as the mass defect of the atom, in the case of mass defect indicates a loss in mass, this is due to the conversion of that defected mass to energy that is evolved as the atom forms. 

The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the nucleons are bound together.
The mass addressed in Einstein's equation is equal to the defect mass, c is the speed of light. Mass is measured in amu or g/mol which is converted to kilograms since that's what a Joule is in the case of mole per nuclei. In the case of the joules per nucleus, It's the mole of nuclei multiplied by Avogadro's number ($6.022*10^{-23}$) nuclei. 
This can be measured through eV or MeV which is the amount of energy necessary to move the charge of an electron across an electric potential difference of 1 volt.

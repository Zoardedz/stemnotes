To start off, we already know the basic types of bonds, ionic and covalent bonds, let's first talk about the bonds in general.

Bonds are literally a force of attraction between atoms or ions, bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence electrons, valence electrons as mentioned in LO 3, they're the electrons in the outermost energy level, there are three different types of chemical bonds, such as the ionic and covalent bonds which we're familiar with already, the newer addition is the metallic bond.

# Ionic bonds

Ionic bonds are forces that arise due to the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, ionic bonds form crystals instead of molecules. Note: Ions can be either molecules or atoms which are electrically charged. Cations are positively charged, meanwhile Anions are negatively charged.
Two ions which are oppositely charged attract each other to form a network (lattice).
When many ions attract each other, they form large, ordered, crystal lattices in which each ion is surrounded by multiple ions of the positive charge.

Ionic bonds are among the strongest of all types of chemical bonds, which allows them to have high melting and boiling points, also making them hard and brittle, they also conduct electricity well when dissolved in water. The electrostatic attraction is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charges on the ions and inversely proportional to the internuclear distance.
Their examples are: NaCl

# Covalent bonds

In a covalent bond, electrons occupy a region of space between the two nuclei and are said to be shared by them, this model was originated with the theory developed by G.N. Lewis in 1916. If the total attraction energy in the bond exceeds the internuclear repulsion there will be a net bonding effect and the molecule will be stable, if however the electron is to one side it will attract both nuclei, therefore it will push the two nuclei apart.

Covalent bonds have a polarity since electrons aren't always shared equally by the two bonded atoms. If a bond connects two atoms of the same element, it has no polarity as the electron is equally shared. But, if you use two atoms of different elements, you'll find that the shared electron(s) aren't shared equally.

The degree of the polarity varies, the polarity scale can just be measured "low to high" through electronegativity. You subtract the electronegativity of the two atoms making the bond to obtain the degree of polarity. If the polarity is less than 0.4 it's considered non-polar (organic compound), if it's more than 0.4 it's considered polar. While if the difference is higher than 1.7 then the compound is considered ionic. If the polarity is 0 then it's an absolutely non-polar compound (a covalent bond of the same element).

The strength of the covalent bond varies, but it comes after ionic bonds.
Like H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O.

# Metallic Bonds

Metals have several qualities that are unique, such as the ability to conduct electricity, a low ionization energy and a low electronegativity. Metallic bonding is like covalent bonding, because it involves sharing electrons. The simplest model of metallic bonding is the "sea of electrons" model, which says that the atoms sit in a sea of valence electrons that are delocalized over all the atoms. This is because there aren't specific bonds between individual atoms, therefore: metals are more flexible. Some metals are very hard and have very high melting points, while others are soft and have low melting points which depends roughly on the number of valence electrons that form the sea.

They're strong and require a great amount of energy to break, therefore again, having high melting and boiling points. 

These occur in the element itself, like magnesium, sodium and aluminum.
# Hydrogen bonds

Hydrogen bonding is a special type of a dipole-dipole attraction between molecules, not a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom, it results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as N, O, or F atoms and another very electronegative atom.

This attraction is an electrostatic force that is generally weak, they're molecular and give new characteristics for example in water.
They're all dipole forces.
# Van der Waals forces

Van der Waals forces are weak intermolecular forces that are dependent on the distance between atoms or molecules. These forces arise from the interactions between uncharged atoms/molecules.

It can arise due to the changing in the polarizations of two particles that are close to each other.

Van der Waals forces are generally the weakest chemical forces, they practically vanish whenever the distance between the interacting molecules increases.

Hydrogen bonds are technically Van der Waals forces, and they're generally a strong Van der Waals force (since Van der Waals forces are weak, hydrogen bonds are still relatively weak.)

Van der Waal forces are dipole forces, which are temporary but not dipole-dipole forces.

This can happen and cause Argon covalent bonds to arise.
# Dipole-Dipole forces

Dipole-Dipole forces are attractive forces that arise between the positive end of a polar covalent bond with the negative end of another negative polar covalent bond, they are much weaker than the ionic or covalent bonds and have a significant effect only when the molecules in the interaction are really close to eachother.

Dipole's can be called permanent Dipoles when they're an ionic bond.

Example: HCl is a permanent dipole bond.
# Sigma bonds

Sigma bonds are a covalent bond which is a result of the head-to head overlapping of atomic orbitals. The overlapping of two elements to form a molecule can change according to the angle, enthalpy and length of the bond, can change it from a pi bond to a sigma bond or the other way around. Sigma bonds are formed by head-on positive overlap of atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis, they're the strongest covalent bonds.

For example: there is one sigma bond for two C-C bonds.

## the internuclear axis is a straight line connecting the center of the two atoms in a bond

s-s Overlapping is when one "s" orbital from each participating atom undergoes head-on overlapping along the internuclear axis, an s orbital must be half filled before it overlaps with another (mainly due to hybridization). 

s-p Overlapping is when one half-filled "s" orbital overlaps with one half-filled "p" orbitals along the internuclear axis forming a covalent bond.

I think you understand the jist, half filled sub-level and sub-level along the internuclear axis causing a covalent bond, apply that same thing for a p-p overlap.

# Pi Bond

Pi bonds are formed by the *sidewise* positive overlap of atomic orbitals, meaning that it's perpendicular to the internuclear axis, during the formation of pi bonds, the axes of the atomic orbitals are parallel to eachother, whereas the overlapping is perpendicular.

Pi bonds are generally weaker than sigma bonds, a pi bond and a sigma bond are double covalent bonds (Except C<sub>2</sub>, typical triple covalent bonds are made of two pi bonds and one sigma bond.

In Pi bonds they must be unhybridized, they don't determine the shape of the molecules.

For example: C<sub>2</sub>

# London Dispersion force

They explain how liquids and solids form in molecules with no permanent dipole moment (non-polar). It arises due to the changes in electrons and their rapid movements, it may cause a temporary dipole moment. The more electrons an atom has, the easier this force arises, because the electrons are held more loosely, far from the nucleus. It arises due to no charge differences.

For example: two chlorine *molecules*.

# Coordinate bonds

Coordinate bonds (Also called a dative covalent bond) are covalent bonds in which the electrons shared come from *the same atom*. The atoms are held together in this case because the electron pair is attracted by both of the nuclei. They mostly happen in the bonding of metal ions to ligands. Which is a part of a dipolar bond.

For example, it can happen between a molecule of ammonia.
